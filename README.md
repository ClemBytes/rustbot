## 💡 The idea

Move a little robot! This started as a way to practice basic programming concepts, but now I'm taking it further in Rust. The goal is to explore Rust's features while keeping the project fun and interactive.

*(This project is a Rust rewrite of my original [C version](https://github.com/ClemBytes/robot) of the robot.)*

## 📁 Project structure

- `src/main.rs` - Server program file
- `static/` - Static files (CSS, robot PNG image…)
- `templates/template.html` - HTML file
- `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock` - Cargo config files
